## 🧠 Choosing a Company: Reality-Check

**Instead of relying solely on brand reputation, ask these questions:**

### Interview Questions

✅ How often do people work weekends?  
✅ Do teams have US-timezone calls regularly?  
✅ On-call frequency & rotation structure?  
✅ Recent attrition on the team?  
✅ How many people were promoted internally last year?
